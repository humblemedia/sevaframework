# Seva: High-Control Group Detection Prompt

Copy everything below the line and paste into Claude, ChatGPT, or Gemini, followed by your source material.

---

You are analyzing content from a group or individual that has raised concerns about potential coercive control dynamics. Your task is to identify linguistic and behavioral patterns associated with high-control environments.

**IMPORTANT:** This is pattern detection, not diagnosis. You are producing an evidence package for human evaluation, not rendering a verdict.

## The Nine Markers

Scan the provided content for these patterns:

### M1: Authority Elevation
- Leader/sponsor positioned as unquestionable authority
- Decisions require approval from authority figure
- Questioning authority = personal failure or spiritual deficiency
- Examples: "My sponsor told me I wasn't allowed to...", "You don't question the process"

### M2: Self-Distrust Normalization
- "Your best thinking got you here"
- Intelligence framed as liability
- Members taught to distrust their own perceptions
- Examples: "Your mind is your enemy", "Check your brain at the door"

### M3: Outside Help Discouragement
- Therapy dismissed or stigmatized
- Medication framed as weakness or lack of faith
- "We're the only thing that really works"
- Examples: "Therapy is just paying someone to listen", "Pills are a crutch"

### M4: In-Group Superiority
- This is the only true/real/authentic method
- Outsiders don't understand
- Superiority about commitment level
- Examples: "Real members don't...", "If you understood, you wouldn't ask"

### M5: Exit Terror
- Leaving framed as catastrophic (death, relapse, damnation)
- Stories of people who left and suffered
- Departure = betrayal or spiritual death
- Examples: "Everyone I know who left is dead or in jail", "You'll lose everything"

### M6: Thought-Terminating Clichés
- Stock phrases that shut down questioning
- "That's your disease/ego talking"
- Loaded language that bypasses critical thinking
- Examples: "It works if you work it", "Your best thinking got you here"

### M7: Relationship/Isolation Control
- Authority figure directs who members can associate with
- Family/friends labeled as "toxic" or "unsupportive"
- Social life managed through group activities
- Examples: "My sponsor told me to cut off my family", "Only spend time with people in the program"

### M8: Financial/Labor Exploitation
- Pressure to give money or unpaid labor
- Financial decisions require approval
- Shame-based contribution expectations
- Examples: "My sponsor told me what car to buy", "Service is expected, not optional"

### M9: Medical/Psychological Interference
- Authority figure overrides professional medical guidance
- Medication decisions controlled by non-medical leader
- Mental health issues reframed as character defects
- Examples: "My sponsor told me to stop my meds", "Depression is just selfishness"

## Phase Estimation (0-5)

Based on marker density and intensity, estimate the control level:

| Phase | Description | Marker Profile |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| 0-1 | Healthy group | Low marker presence, autonomy respected, positive indicators present |
| 2 | Boundary testing | Authority elevation begins, subtle self-distrust messaging |
| 3 | Systematic control | Multiple markers present (4+), control architecture becoming visible |
| 4 | Exit terror active | High density (6+ markers), leaving = catastrophe, isolation increasing |
| 5 | Total control | M7+M8+M9 present together, documented harm, complete dependency |

## Output Format

For each marker detected, provide:

1. **Quote:** The specific passage (with source/timestamp if available)
2. **Marker:** Which marker it represents (M1-M9)
3. **Intensity:** LOW / MODERATE / HIGH / CRITICAL
4. **Context:** Brief note on why this qualifies

Then provide:

### Summary
- **Phase Estimate:** [0-5] with confidence level (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)
- **Most Concerning Patterns:** Top 2-3 findings
- **Positive Indicators:** Any autonomy language, healthy boundaries, choice emphasis
- **Limitations:** What this analysis cannot determine

### Evidence Table

| # | Quote | Marker | Intensity | Source |
|---|-------|--------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | "..." | M1 | HIGH | [source] |
| 2 | "..." | M5 | MODERATE | [source] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
