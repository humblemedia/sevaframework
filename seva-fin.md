# Seva-FIN: Financial Grift Detection Prompt

Copy everything below the line and paste into Claude, ChatGPT, or Gemini, followed by promotional material, Discord messages, whitepaper excerpts, or other content.

---

You are analyzing promotional content from a financial opportunity, investment, or business venture. Your task is to identify linguistic patterns associated with financial manipulation and potential fraud.

**IMPORTANT:** High scores indicate risk patterns, not proof of fraud. This is due diligence assistance, not legal determination. "Signals, not verdicts."

## The Ten Markers

### M1: Income Mystification
- Lifestyle flex without verifiable proof
- "Unlimited earning potential" claims
- Screenshots of earnings (easily faked)
- Vague about actual revenue sources
- Examples: Lamborghini in thumbnail, "I made $50K this month" without documentation

### M2: Urgency Manufacturing
- "Limited time" / "closing soon" / countdown timers
- FOMO-inducing language
- Artificial scarcity ("only 100 spots")
- Pressure to decide before researching
- Examples: "Price goes up at midnight", "This opportunity won't last"

### M3: Authority Fabrication
- Unverifiable credentials or connections
- Name-dropping without substance
- "As seen on..." without verification
- Fake expertise signaling
- Examples: "Advised by [celebrity]", credentials that don't check out

### M4: Exit-Blame Setup
- Pre-blaming failures on participant effort
- "Only works if you work it"
- "Paper hands" / weak mindset framing
- Responsibility shifted before you even start
- Examples: "If you fail, you didn't follow the system", "Not for people who give up"

### M5: Thought-Termination
- "FUD" (fear, uncertainty, doubt) as dismissal
- "Haters gonna hate"
- "DYOR" used to deflect, not inform
- Critics labeled jealous/ignorant
- Examples: "That's just FUD", "If you have to ask, you won't understand"

### M6: Complexity Shield
- Jargon to obscure, not explain
- Technical language without substance
- Complexity as credibility theater
- Can't explain it simply because there's nothing there
- Examples: "Quantum AI neural blockchain synergy", meaningless tokenomics

### M7: Community Capture
- "We're family" / identity merger with investment
- Us vs. them framing
- Coordinated harassment of critics
- Social pressure to defend the project
- Examples: "Diamond hands family", organized attacks on skeptics

### M8: Reflexive Economics
- Value depends entirely on new buyers (Ponzi structure)
- Tokenomics that punish selling
- No external value creation
- "Number go up" as only thesis
- Examples: Reflection tokens, "buy and hold forever", no actual product

### M9: Charity Hijacking
- Cause used as marketing cover
- Charity name in project title
- Emotional manipulation via social good
- Actual charitable impact unclear or absent
- Examples: "Save the Kids" token, vague donation promises

### M10: Celebrity Shield
- Fame substituted for fundamentals
- "Would [celebrity] really scam?"
- Parasocial trust exploitation
- Celebrity likely paid, not invested
- Examples: Influencer promotion without disclosure, "backed by [famous person]"

## Scoring

Rate each marker 0-10 based on presence and intensity:
- 0: Not present

| 81-100 | Extreme risk. Classic scam patterns. Run. |

## Output Format

### Marker Analysis

| **TOTAL** | **XX/100** | |

### Assessment

- **Risk Level:** [Low / Moderate / High / Extreme]
- **Confidence:** [Low / Medium / High] — based on amount of material analyzed
- **Most Concerning Patterns:** Top 2-3 red flags
- **Legitimacy Indicators:** Anything that suggests genuine value (if present)
- **Recommendation:** What due diligence remains before any decision

### Limitations

- Marketing ≠ fraud — aggressive marketing is legal, even if annoying
- Evolving vocabulary — scammers adapt their language
- Sophisticated actors — some scams score lower because they're more polished
- This is pattern recognition, not proof of criminality
